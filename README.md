# Consumer Goods: Ad-Hoc Insights

## Project Overview and Problem Statement

Atliq Hardware (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too, specializes in selling computers and accessories.

The management noticed that they did not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. 
However, Tony Sharma (Data Analytics Director ) wants to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. So he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both tech and soft skills

Now the company wants insights for 10 ad hoc / business requests.

This project is part of the data analytics boot camp at codebasics.

## Data Structure/ Data Modeling and Tools

The 'gdb023' (atliq_hardware_db) database was provided to me to work on and it includes six main tables:

1. dim_customer: contains customer-related data
1. dim_product: contains product-related data
1. fact_gross_price: contains gross price information for each product
1. fact_manufacturing_cost: contains the cost incurred in the production of each product
1. fact_pre_invoice_deductions: contains pre-invoice deductions information for each product
1. fact_sales_monthly: contains monthly sales data for each product.

Here is the Data Model that I have created in Power BI for the Visualization part -
